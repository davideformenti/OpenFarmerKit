# INTRODUCION

OPEN FARMER KIT
  Repository for developing the OFK (Open Farmer Kit) Environment. 
  The project has been developed only using Arduino UNO and WEMOS D1 ESP8266 boards. 


# REQUIREMENTS
  The entire environment is made up by 3 wireless & autonomous modules communicating with a main one that ghaters information about the sorrounding green conditions. Another wired module that sends air and temperature measures is wired-connected with the op server making the whole environment made up by 5 elements.
  The setup is made by:
    
  ## OPMODULE
  ## AIR & TEMPERATURE MODULE
  ## MOISTURE MODULE
  ## SOIL DISPLAY MODULE
  ## BIODIVERSITY MODULE

# SETUP & WIRING
  In this section will be discussing about wiring and connections to get all the different modules working and communicating one with each other.
